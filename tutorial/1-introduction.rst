1.1 Goal of OpenXR
******************

OpenXR aims to help solve the fragmentation of the XR ecosystem. Before the advent of OpenXR, software developers working with multiple hardware platforms had to write different code paths for each platform to address the different hardware. Each platform had its own, often proprietary, API, and deploying an existing application to a new platform required a lot of adaptation. Developing a new application for a new platform was even more challenging. Documentation for the OpenXR 1.0 Core Specification can be found `<https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/html/xrspec.html>`_.

Despite of their unique features, the platforms had a great deal in common. For example, most headsets had a main view seen from two slightly different perspectives. Most had a way to track the user's head and hands or hand controllers. Most had buttons, many had analogue controls like triggers or joysticks and many had haptic feedback.

	OpenXR provides a common interface to reduce XR fragmentation.

OpenXR aims to solve this problem by providing a common API to address XR hardware, in reading its inputs
and outputting to its displays and haptic systems. Just as OpenGL and Vulkan provide a common API to access graphics hardware, so OpenXR allows you to write code that works with multiple XR platforms, with minimal adaptation.

************
1.2 Overview
************

We'll start with the main concepts you'll need to be familiar with around OpenXR.

.. list-table:: OpenXR Concepts
	:widths: 1 5
	:class: longtable
	:header-rows: 1

	* - Concept
	  - Description
	* - API
	  - The OpenXR API is the set of commands, functions and structures that an OpenXR-compliant runtime is required to offer.
	* - Application
	  - The Application is your program, called an "app" for short.
	* - Runtime
	  - A Runtime is a specific implementation of the OpenXR functionality. It might be provided by a hardware vendor, as part of a device's operating system; it might be supplied by a software vendor to enable OpenXR support with a specific range of hardware. The Loader finds the appropriate Runtime	and loads it when OpenXR is initialized.
	* - Loader
	  - The OpenXR Loader is a special library that connects your application to whichever OpenXR Runtime you're using. The Loader's job is to find the Runtime and initialize it, then allow your application to access the Runtime's version of the API. Some devices can have multiple Runtimes available, but only one can be active at any given time.
	* - Layers
	  - API layers are optional components that augment an OpenXR system. A Layer might help with debugging, or filter information between the application and the Runtime. API layers are selectively enabled when the OpenXR Instance is created.
	* - Instance
	  - The Instance is the foundational object that allows your application to communicate with a Runtime. You'll ask OpenXR to create an Instance when initializing XR support in your application.
	* - Graphics
	  - OpenXR needs to connect to a graphics API in order to render the headset views. Which Graphics APIs are supported depends on the Runtime and the hardware.
	* - Input/Output
	  - OpenXR allows apps to query what inputs and outputs are available. These can then be bound to Actions, so the app knows what the user is doing.
	* - Action
	  - A semantically-defined input or output for the app, which can be bound to different hardware inputs or outputs using Bindings.
	* - Binding
	  - A mapping from hardware/Runtime-defined inputs and outputs to semantic Actions.
	* - Pose
	  - A position and orientation in 3D space.


OpenXR provides a clear and precise common language for developers and hardware vendors to use.

An OpenXR Runtime implements the OpenXR API. The runtime translates the OpenXR function calls into something that the vendor's software/hardware can understand.

The OpenXR Loader finds and loads a suitable OpenXR runtime that is present on the system. The Loader will load in all of the OpenXR function pointers stated in the core specification for the application to use. If you are using an extension, such as :openxr_ref:`XR_EXT_debug_utils`, any functions associated with that extension will need to be loaded in with :openxr_ref:`xrGetInstanceProcAddr`. Some platforms like Android require extra work and information to initialize the loader. Documentation for the OpenXR Loader can be found `<https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/loader.html>`_.

API Layers are additional code layers that are inserted by the loader between the application and the runtime. Each of these API layers intercepts the OpenXR function calls from the layer above, does something with that function, and then calls the next layer down. Examples of API Layers would be: logging the OpenXR functions to the output or a file; creating trace files of the OpenXR calls for later replay; or for checking that the function calls made to OpenXR are compatible with the OpenXR specification. See :ref:`Chapter 6.3 <6.3 OpenXR API Layers>`.

OpenXR supports multiple graphics APIs via its extension functionality. OpenXR can extend its functionality to include debugging layers, vendor hardware and software support and graphics APIs. This idea of absolving the core specification of the graphics API functionality provides flexibility in choosing the graphics APIs now and in the future. OpenXR is targeted at developing XR experiences and isn't concerned with the specifics of any graphics APIs. The extensible nature of OpenXR allows revisions of existing APIs and new graphics APIs to be integrated with ease. See :ref:`Chapter 5 <5 Extensions>`.

OpenXR recognizes that there is a vast and ever-changing array of hardware and configurations in the XR space. With new headsets and controllers coming to the market, an abstraction of the input system was needed so that the same applications can target different and newer hardware with minimal change. This is the core reasoning behind the OpenXR Actions System.

1.3 Environment Setup
*********************

This section will help you set up your development environment. Here your choice of platform makes a difference, but afterwards, things will be much more consistent. You can change platform and graphics API at any time by clicking the tabs at the top of the page. Select the platform you want to develop for now, by clicking the appropriate tab above.

.. only:: windows or linux

	You should make sure that the XR runtime that you wish to use is made the default for the XR loader to recognize and load for your application.

.. only:: windows

	.. rubric:: Visual Studio

*****************
1.4 Project Setup
*****************

This section explains how to set up your project ready for :ref:`Chapter 2<2.1 Creating an Instance>` and will make references to the ``/Chapter2`` folder. It explains how to include the OpenXR headers, link the ``openxr_loader`` library, graphics API integration, and other boilerplate code and finally create a simple stub application which will be expanded on in later chapters.

1.4.1 CMake and Project Files
=============================

.. only:: windows

	For the Microsoft Windows OpenXR project, we'll use CMake to create the solution and project files for Visual Studio.
	Create a directory where the code will go, we'll call this the *workspace* directory.

.. only:: linux

	You can use any code editor and/or compiler with OpenXR; this tutorial will use Visual Studio Code as an example. For the Linux OpenXR project, we'll use CMake alongside VS Code to build the project. Create a directory where the code will go, we'll call this the *workspace* directory. Open Visual Studio Code and from the File menu, select "Open Folder..."

	.. figure:: linux-vscode-open-folder.png
		:alt: The File menu of Visual Studio Code is shown, with the command "Open Folder..." selected.
		:scale: 55%

	Select your *workspace* folder, which is currently empty.

	If you haven't previously done so, install the CMake extension for Visual Studio Code: select the "Extensions" tab, and type "CMake" in the search box.

	.. figure:: images/VSCodeCMakeLinux.png
		:alt: Selecting the CMake extension in Visual Studio Code.
		:align: left
		:scale: 55%

.. only:: windows or linux

	Create a folder called ``cmake`` in the *workspace* directory. Download the linked file below and put it in ``cmake``. This will be used in our ``CMakeLists.txt`` to help build our project.

	.. only:: d3d11 or d3d12

		:download:`fxc_shader.cmake <../cmake/fxc_shader.cmake>`

	.. only:: opengl

		:download:`gfxwrapper.cmake <../cmake/gfxwrapper.cmake>`

	.. only:: vulkan

		:download:`glsl_shader.cmake <../cmake/glsl_shader.cmake>`

	Now, create a text file in the *workspace* folder called ``CMakeLists.txt`` and in it, put the following code:

	.. literalinclude:: ../CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_CMakeLists
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_CMakeLists

	Here, we specify the CMake version, project name and configuration types, and provide a CMake variable called ``XR_RUNTIME_JSON`` which you can use to point to the runtime you will be using (by default, OpenXR will try to find the standard runtime from your hardware vendor). Finally, we specify CMake to continue the build into the Chapter2 directory with ``add_subdirectory()``.

	.. literalinclude:: ../CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_AddChapter2
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_AddChapter2
		:dedent: 4

	In the *workspace* folder, create a folder called ``Chapter2``, and in it create another ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. Into the ``Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt``, put the following code:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_SetProjectName2
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_SetProjectName2

	This sets a minimum CMake version (required for some of the features we use here) and our own CMake variable ``PROJECT_NAME`` which is set to ``OpenXRTutorialChapter2``. Now add:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_CMakeModulePath
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_CMakeModulePath

	Now, we append to the ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` variable an additional path for ``find_package()`` to search within.

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_FetchContent
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_FetchContent

	We include ``FetchContent`` and use it to get the OpenXR-SDK-Source from Khronos's GitHub page.

	Now, we will add to ``Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt`` the source and header files by adding the following code. Here, we are including all the files needed for our project.

	.. only:: d3d11

		.. code-block:: cmake

			# Files
			set(SOURCES
				"main.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_D3D11.cpp"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.cpp")
			set(HEADERS
				"../Common/DebugOutput.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_D3D11.h"
				"../Common/HelperFunctions.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRHelper.h")

	.. only:: d3d12

		.. code-block:: cmake

			# Files
			set(SOURCES
				"main.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_D3D12.cpp"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.cpp")
			set(HEADERS
				"../Common/DebugOutput.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_D3D12.h"
				"../Common/HelperFunctions.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRHelper.h")

	.. only:: opengl

		.. code-block:: cmake

			# Files
			set(SOURCES
				"main.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_OpenGL.cpp"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.cpp")
			set(HEADERS
				"../Common/DebugOutput.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_OpenGL.h"
				"../Common/HelperFunctions.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRHelper.h")

	.. only:: vulkan

		.. code-block:: cmake

			# Files

				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.cpp"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_Vulkan.cpp"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.cpp")
			set(HEADERS
				"../Common/DebugOutput.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI.h"
				"../Common/GraphicsAPI_Vulkan.h"
				"../Common/HelperFunctions.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRDebugUtils.h"
				"../Common/OpenXRHelper.h")

	All the files listed above with ``../Common/*.*`` are available to download below. In the next section, you will find the links and a discussion of their usage. This tutorial includes all the graphics APIs header and cpp files; you only need to download the files for your chosen graphics API.

	Add the following code to ``Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt``:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_WindowsLinux
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_WindowsLinux
		:dedent: 4

	We have used ``add_executable()`` to create the program we'll be building, and specified its ``${SOURCES}`` and ``${HEADERS}``. We passed the ``XR_RUNTIME_JSON`` variable on to the debugging environment (Windows only). We've added the ``../Common``, ``"${openxr_SOURCE_DIR}/src/common"`` and ``"${openxr_SOURCE_DIR}/external/include"`` folders as include directories and linked the ``openxr_loader`` which we obtained with ``FetchContent``. This will also add the include directory for the OpenXR headers.

	.. only:: windows

		.. only:: d3d11

			.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
				:language: cmake
				:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_D3D11
				:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_D3D11
				:dedent: 8

		.. only:: d3d12

			.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
				:language: cmake
				:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_D3D12
				:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_D3D12
				:dedent: 8

		.. only:: d3d11 or d3d12

			.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
				:language: cmake
				:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_D3D11_12
				:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_D3D11_12
				:dedent: 8

		.. only:: d3d11

			For Microsoft Windows, we've linked ``d3d11.lib`` and ``dxgi.lib``, so that we can use Direct3D 11 and the DirectX Graphics Infrastructure. The headers for Direct3D are automatically included as part of the Visual Studio project. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_D3D11`` compiler definition to specify which graphics APIs should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``.

		.. only:: d3d12

			For Microsoft Windows, we've linked ``d3d12.lib`` and ``dxgi.lib``, so that we can use Direct3D 12 and the DirectX Graphics Infrastructure. The headers for Direct3D are automatically included as part of the Visual Studio project. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_D3D12`` compiler definition to specify which graphics APIs should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``.

	.. only:: linux

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
			:language: cmake
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_Linux
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_Linux
			:dedent: 8

		For Linux, there are no headers to include or libraries to link against. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_LINUX_XLIB`` compiler definition to specify which Linux Windowing System should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``. Other options are ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_LINUX_XCB`` and ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_LINUX_WAYLAND``. Wayland uses *EGL* for its *OpenGL ES* context and not *GLX* with *OpenGL*.

	.. only:: opengl

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
			:language: cmake
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_OpenGL
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_OpenGL
			:dedent: 4

		We include the ``gfxwrapper.cmake`` from our ``cmake`` folder in the *workspace* directory. This file creates a static library called ``openxr-gfxwrapper``, which will allow us to use OpenGL. We link against ``openxr-gfxwrapper``, which also provide us with the needed include directories. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_OPENGL`` compiler definition to specify which graphics APIs should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``.

	.. only:: vulkan

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
			:language: cmake
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_VulkanSDK
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_VulkanSDK
			:dedent: 4

		If you have the Vulkan SDK installed, this CMake code will try to find that package, add the include directories and link the Vulkan libraries. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_VULKAN`` compiler definition to specify which graphics APIs should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``.

	That's all the CMake code that we require for this project.

.. only:: android

	**For a quick setup download this ``.zip`` archive:**

	:git_release:`AndroidBuildFolder.zip`

	First, create a *workspace* folder and copy the downloaded zip archive into that folder. Unzip the archive in place and rename the ``AndroidBuildFolder`` folder to ``Chapter2``. You can delete the used zip archive as it's no longer needed. Open Android Studio and then open the ``Chapter2`` foler that was created.

	*Now follow instructions under the CMake and CMakeLists.txt headings of this sub-chapter and then go straight on to 1.4.2 Common Files.*

	**For a detailed explantion of the Android build folder set up continue below:**

	.. rubric:: Android Studio

	Here, We'll show how to hand build an Android Studio project that runs a C++ Native Activity.
	First, we will create a *workspace* folder and in that folder create a subdirectory called ``/Chapter2``.
	Open Android Studio, select New Project and choose an Empty Views Activity (Android Studio 22+) or an Empty Activity (Android Studio up to version 21).

	.. figure:: images/android-studio-newproject.png
		:alt: Android Studio - New Project - Empty View Activity.
		:scale: 55%

	Set the Name to 'OpenXR Tutorial Chapter 2', the Package name to ``org.khronos.openxrtutorialchapter2`` and save location to that ``Chapter2`` folder. 	The language can be ignored here as we are using C++, and we can set the Minimum SDK to API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher. If a "Build Configuration Language" option is shown, set this to ``Groovy DSL (build.gradle)``. Click "Finish" to complete the set up.

	.. figure:: images/android-studio-newproject-options.png
		:alt: Android Studio - New Project - options.
		:scale: 55%

	With the Android Studio project now set up, we need to modify some of the files and folders to support the C++ Native Activity.

	In Android Studio, switch to the "Project" view in the "Project" tab (on the top right of the default Android Studio layout).

	Under the ``app`` folder in ``Chapter2``, you can delete the ``libs`` folder, and under the ``app/src`` you can also delete the ``androidTest`` and ``test`` folders. Finally under ``app/src/main``, delete the ``java`` folder. Under the ``app/src/main/res``, delete the ``layout``, ``values-night`` and ``xml`` folders. Under the ``values`` folder, delete ``colors.xml`` and ``themes.xml``.

	Now sync the project by selecting "File > Sync Project with Gradle" on the menu.

	.. figure:: images/GradleSync.png
		:alt: Gradle Sync
		:scale: 55%

	.. rubric:: CMake

	.. only:: opengles

		Create a folder called ``cmake`` in the *workspace* directory. Download the linked files below and put them in ``cmake``. These will be used by CMake to help build our project.

		:download:`gfxwrapper.cmake <../cmake/gfxwrapper.cmake>`
		:download:`FindEGL.cmake <../cmake/FindEGL.cmake>`
		:download:`FindOpenGLES.cmake <../cmake/FindOpenGLES.cmake>`

	.. only:: vulkan

		Create a folder called ``cmake`` in the *workspace* directory. Download the linked file below and put it in ``cmake``. This will be used by CMake to help build our project. Files with ``shader`` in the name will be used in later chapters.

		:download:`glsl_shader.cmake <../cmake/glsl_shader.cmake>`

	Create a text file called ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the ``Chapter2`` directory. We will use this file to specify how our Native C++ code will be built. This file will be invoked by Android Studio's Gradle build system.

	.. rubric:: CMakeLists.txt

	Add the following to your new CMakeLists.txt file:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_SetProjectName2
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_SetProjectName2

	Here we have declared our tutorial project. At least CMake 3.28.3 is needed to use all the features in the tutorial. Now add:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_CMakeModulePath
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_CMakeModulePath

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_FetchContent
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_FetchContent

	After setting our CMake version, our own CMake variable ``PROJECT_NAME`` to ``OpenXRTutorialChapter2`` and with that variable setting the project's name, we append to the ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` variable an additional path for ``find_package()`` to search within and we include ``FetchContent`` and use it to get the OpenXR-SDK-Source from Khronos's GitHub page.

	Here, we include all the files needed for our project. All files with ``../Common/*.*`` are available to download from this tutorial website. Below are the links and discussion of their usage within this tutorial and with OpenXR. This tutorial includes all the graphics APIs header and cpp files; you only need to download the files pertaining to your graphics API choice.

	Add the following to CMakeLists.txt:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
		:language: cmake
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_Android
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_Android
		:dedent: 4

	We have added a library with the ``${SOURCES}`` and ``${HEADERS}`` and have added the ``../Common``, ``"${openxr_SOURCE_DIR}/src/common"`` and ``"${openxr_SOURCE_DIR}/external/include"`` folders as include directories. We have set the ``LINK_FLAGS`` for our project with the flag ``-u ANativeActivity_onCreate()`` to support C++ native code. This is used by a static library called ``native_app_glue``, which connects the Java Virtual Machine and our C++ code. Ultimately, it allows us to use the ``android_main()`` entry point.  We add ``native_app_glue`` to our project by including ``AndroidNdkModules`` and calling:

	``android_ndk_import_module_native_app_glue()``.

	Now, we link the ``android``, ``native_app_glue`` and ``openxr_loader`` libraries to our ``OpenXRTutorialChapter2`` library. Our ``libOpenXRTutorialChapter2 .so`` will be packaged inside our .apk along with any shared libraries that we have linked. We also add ``-Wno-cast-calling-convention`` to the compiler option to allow the casting of calling conversions for function pointers.

	Now, add:

	.. only:: opengles

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
			:language: cmake
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_Gfxwrapper
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_Gfxwrapper
			:dedent: 4

		We include the ``gfxwrapper.cmake`` from our ``cmake`` folder in the *workspace* directory. This file creates a static library called ``openxr-gfxwrapper``, which will allow us to use OpenGL ES. We link against ``openxr-gfxwrapper``, which also provides us with the needed include directories. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_OPENGL_ES`` compiler definition to specify which graphics APIs should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``.

	.. only:: vulkan

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/CMakeLists.txt
			:language: cmake
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_VulkanNDK
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_VulkanNDK
			:dedent: 4

		Here we find the Vulkan library in the NDK. We include the directory to the Android Vulkan headers and link against the ``libvulkan.so`` library. We've added the ``XR_TUTORIAL_USE_VULKAN`` compiler definition to specify which graphics APIs should be supported and have their headers included in ``GraphicsAPI.h``.

	.. rubric:: AndroidManifest.xml

	Replace the file 'app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml' with the following:

	Download :download:`AndroidManifest.xml <../Chapter2/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml>`.
	You can open the file. You don't need to edit it, but note:

	* We added a ``<uses-feature>`` to require OpenGL ES 3.2 and Vulkan 1.0.3 support.
	* Next, we added ``android.hardware.vr.headtracking`` to specify that the application works with 3DOF or 6DOF and on devices that are not all-in-ones. It's set to false so as to allow greater compatibility across devices.
	* Finally, we updated the ``<intent-filter>`` to tell the application that it should take over rendering when active, rather than appearing in a window. We set:

	``<category android:name="org.khronos.openxr.intent.category.IMMERSIVE_HMD" />``

	Note: not all devices yet support this category. For example, for Meta Quest devices you will need

	``<category android:name="com.oculus.intent.category.VR" />``

	The code shows both the 'Standard Khronos OpenXR' and 'Meta Quest-specific non-standard' ways of setting the intent filter. If you're building for another Android-based XR device which does not support all of the standard commands used here, you may need to look up the appropriate commands and modify the manifest.

	.. rubric:: Gradle

	Now download :download:`app/build.gradle <../Chapter2/app/build.gradle>` and replace the existing file ``app/build.gradle``.

	In the ``dependencies`` section we have added:

	``implementation 'org.khronos.openxr:openxr_loader_for_android:...'``

	This provides an ``AndroidManifest.xml`` that will be merged into our own, setting some required properties for the package and application. We are still required to add to our own ``AndroidManifest.xml`` file with relevant intent filters, such as ``org.khronos.openxr.intent.category.IMMERSIVE_HMD``. It also provides the OpenXR headers and library binaries in a format that the Android Gradle Plugin will expose to CMake.

	Now download :download:`build.gradle <../Chapter2/build.gradle>` and replace the existing file in the ``Chapter2`` folder.

1.4.2 Common Files

	* :git_release:`Common_OpenGL.zip`

.. only:: opengles

	* :git_release:`Common_OpenGL_ES.zip`

.. only:: vulkan

	* :git_release:`Common_Vulkan.zip`

.. rubric::  DebugOutput

``DebugOutput`` is a class that redirects ``std::cout`` and ``std::cerr`` to the output window in your IDE.

.. only:: windows

	``DebugOutput`` uses ``OutputDebugStringA()`` to log the message to the Visual Studio Output window.

.. only:: linux

	``DebugOutput`` will not redirect the output a Visual Studio Code window. The output will remain in the terminal.

.. only:: android

	``DebugOutput`` uses ``__android_log_write()`` to log the message to Android Logcat.

.. rubric::  HelperFunctions

This is a simple header file for boilerplate code for the various platforms. It includes various C/C++ standard header and the code that defines the macro ``DEBUG_BREAK``, according to which platform we're building for. This macro will stop the execution of your program when an error occurs, so you can see where it happened and fix it. We use this macro in the ``OpenXRMessageCallbackFunction()`` function, which is discussed in detail in :ref:`Chapter 2.1<2.1.2 XR_EXT_debug_utils>`.
``IsStringInVector()`` and ``BitwiseCheck()`` are just simple wrappers over commonly used code. ``IsStringInVector()`` checks if a ``const char *`` is in a ``std::vector<const char *>`` by using ``strcmp()``, and ``BitwiseCheck()`` checks if a bit is set in a bitfield.

.. rubric::  OpenXRDebugUtils

A header and cpp file pair that helps in setting up the DebugUtilsMessenger. :openxr_ref:`XR_EXT_debug_utils` is an OpenXR instance extension that can intercept calls made to OpenXR and provide extra information or report warnings and errors, if the usage of the API or the current state of OpenXR is not valid. As you go through this tutorial it is highly recommended to have this enabled to help with debugging. This is discussed in detail in :ref:`Chapter 2.1<2.1.2 XR_EXT_debug_utils>`, but in general, ``CreateOpenXRDebugUtilsMessenger()`` creates and ``DestroyOpenXRDebugUtilsMessenger()`` destroys an :openxr_ref:`XrDebugUtilsMessengerEXT`. ``OpenXRMessageCallbackFunction()`` is a callback function that is specified at object creation, which is called when OpenXR raises an issue. The header declares the functions and the cpp defines them.

.. rubric::  OpenXRHelper

A header for including all the needed header files and helper functions. Looking inside this file, we can see:

.. literalinclude:: ../Common/OpenXRHelper.h
	:language: cpp
	:start-at: // Define any
	:end-at: #include <openxr/openxr_platform.h>
	:emphasize-lines: 5

Here, we include the main OpenXR header file ``openxr.h`` and the OpenXR platform header file ``openxr_platform.h``. For the OpenXR platform header file, note the comment about using the preceding ``XR_USE_PLATFORM_...`` and ``XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_...`` macros. When enabled, we gain access to functionality that interacts with the chosen graphics API and/or platform. These macros are automatically set by ``GraphicsAPI.h``

This header also defines the macro ``OPENXR_CHECK``. Many OpenXR functions return an :openxr_ref:`XrResult`. This macro will check if the call has failed and will log a message to ``std::cerr``. This can be modified to suit your needs. There are two additional functions ``GetXRErrorString()`` and ``OpenXRDebugBreak()``, which are used to convert the :openxr_ref:`XrResult` to a string and as a breakpoint function respectively.

1.4.3 Main.cpp and the OpenXRTutorial Class
===========================================

Now, create a text file called ``main.cpp`` in the ``Chapter2`` folder. Open ``main.cpp`` and add the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:start-at: #include <DebugOutput
	:end-at: .h>

Next, we add the ``GraphicsAPI_....h`` header to include the ``GraphicsAPI`` code of your chosen graphics API. This will in turn include ``GraphicsAPI.h``, ``HelperFunctions.h``  and ``OpenXRHelper.h``.

.. only:: d3d11

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_include_GraphicsAPI_D3D11
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_include_GraphicsAPI_D3D11

.. only:: d3d12

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_include_GraphicsAPI_D3D12
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_include_GraphicsAPI_D3D12

.. only:: opengl

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_include_GraphicsAPI_OpenGL
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_include_GraphicsAPI_OpenGL

.. only:: opengles

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_include_GraphicsAPI_OpenGL_ES
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_include_GraphicsAPI_OpenGL_ES

.. only:: vulkan

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_include_GraphicsAPI_Vulkan
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_include_GraphicsAPI_Vulkan

You can also include ``OpenXRDebugUtils.h`` to help with the set-up of :openxr_ref:`XrDebugUtilsMessengerEXT`.

.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_include_OpenXRDebugUtils
	:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_include_OpenXRDebugUtils

Now we will define the main class ``OpenXRTutorial`` of the application. It's just a stub class for now, with an empty ``Run()`` method. Add the following to ``main.cpp``:

.. code-block:: cpp

	class OpenXRTutorial {
	public:
		OpenXRTutorial(GraphicsAPI_Type apiType)
		{
		}
		~OpenXRTutorial() = default;
		void Run()
		{
		}
	private:
		void PollSystemEvents()
		{
		}
	private:
		bool m_applicationRunning = true;
		bool m_sessionRunning = false;
	};

Note here that for some platforms, we need additional functionality provided via the ``PollSystemEvents()`` method, so that our application can react to any relevant updates from the platform correctly.

.. only:: windows or linux

	For Windows and Linux, there are no relevant system events that we need to be aware of, and thus the ``PollSystemEvents()`` method definition can be left blank.

.. only:: android

	The ``PollSystemEvents()`` method is outside the scope of OpenXR, but in general it will poll Android for system events, updates and uses the ``AndroidAppState``, ``m_applicationRunning`` and ``m_sessionRunning`` members, which we describe later in this chapter.

We'll add the main function for the application. It will look slightly different, depending on your
chosen platform. We first create a 'pseudo-main function' called ``OpenXRTutorial_Main()``, in which we create an instance of our ``OpenXRTutorial`` class, taking a ``GraphicsAPI_Type`` parameter, and call the ``Run()`` method. ``GraphicsAPI_Type`` can be changed to suit the graphics API that you have chosen.

.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:start-at: void OpenXRTutorial_Main(GraphicsAPI_Type apiType) {
	:end-at: }

Then, we create the actual platform-specific main function (our entry point to the application), which will call ``OpenXRTutorial_Main()`` with our ``GraphicsAPI_Type`` parameter. This must be changed to match on your chosen graphics API, one of: ``D3D11``, ``D3D12``, ``OPENGL``, ``OPENGL_ES``, or ``VULKAN``.

.. only:: windows or linux

	.. only:: d3d11

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
			:language: cpp
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_main_Windows_Linux_D3D11
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_main_Windows_Linux_D3D11

	.. only:: d3d12

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
			:language: cpp
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_main_Windows_Linux_D3D12
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_main_Windows_Linux_D3D12

	.. only:: opengl

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
			:language: cpp
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_main_Windows_Linux_OPENGL
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_main_Windows_Linux_OPENGL

	.. only:: vulkan

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
			:language: cpp
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_main_Windows_Linux_VULKAN
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_main_Windows_Linux_VULKAN

.. only:: android

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_android_main___ANDROID__
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_android_main___ANDROID__

	And we will initialize the app with your chosen API:

	.. only:: opengles

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
			:language: cpp
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_android_main_OPENGL_ES
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_android_main_OPENGL_ES

	.. only:: vulkan

		.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
			:language: cpp
			:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_android_main_VULKAN
			:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_android_main_VULKAN

	Before we can use OpenXR for Android, we need to initialize the loader based the application's context and virtual machine. We retrieve the function pointer to :openxr_ref:`xrInitializeLoaderKHR`, and with the :openxr_ref:`XrLoaderInitInfoAndroidKHR` filled out, call that function to initialize OpenXR for our use. At this point, we also attach the current thread to the Java Virtual Machine. We assign our ``AndroidAppState`` static member and our ``AndroidAppHandleCmd()`` static method to the ``android_app *`` and save it to a static member in the class.

	Android requires a few extra additions to the OpenXRTutorial class. Namely, ``android_app *``, ``AndroidAppState`` and ``AndroidAppHandleCmd``, which are used in getting updates from the Android Operating System and keep our application functioning. Add the following code after the definition of ``Run()`` in your ``OpenXRTutorial`` class declaration:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_Android_System_Functionality1
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_Android_System_Functionality1

	And into ``PollSystemEvents()`` method copy:

	.. literalinclude:: ../Chapter2/main.cpp
		:language: cpp
		:start-after: XR_DOCS_TAG_BEGIN_Android_System_Functionality2
		:end-before: XR_DOCS_TAG_END_Android_System_Functionality2
		:dedent: 8


1.4.4 Build and Run
===================

.. only:: windows

	In the *workspace* directory, create a ``build/`` folder, which will contain our project, solution and output binary files. Now launch the CMake GUI, and point the "Where is the source code" box to the *workspace* directory, where your original ``CMakeLists.txt`` is located. Point the "Where to build the binaries" box to a subdirectory called ``build``, that we have just created. Click "Configure" and "OK" to accept the default Generator, then click "Generate" to create the Visual Studio solution and project. Finally, click "Open Project" to open that solution with Visual Studio.

	If you wish to build the project with CMake at the terminal, use the following commands to configure and generate the project:

	.. code-block:: batch

		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake -G "<your_visual_studio_version>" ../

	You can now build and run your program. It should compile and link with no errors or warnings, but it won't run correctly yet.

.. only:: linux

	You now have all the files and folders, laid out as follows:

	.. figure:: images/linux-vscode-initial-files.png
		:alt: Initial files in VS Code
		:scale: 100%

	Having installed the CMake extension for VS Code, you can now right-click on the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file (the one in the root *workspace* folder). We can select “Configure and Build All” from the right-click menu of the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

	.. figure:: linux-vscode-cmake-configure.png
		:alt: Select
		:scale: 55%

	If you wish to build the project with CMake at the terminal, use the following commands to configure and generate the project:

	.. code-block:: bash

		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake -G "<your_generator>" ../

	If you haven't previously done so, install the gdb extension for VS Code: select the "Extensions" tab, and type "gdb" in the search box. To enable debugging, select the Run/Debug panel in Visual Studio Code. You will now need to create a debugging configuration.
	Click the link "create a launch.json file" to and enter the following in launch.json:

	.. code-block:: json

		{
			"version": "0.2.0",
			"configurations": [
				{
					"type": "cppdbg",
					"request": "launch",
					"name": "Chapter2",
					"program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/Chapter2/OpenXRTutorialChapter2",
					"cwd":"${workspaceFolder}/Chapter2"
				}
			]
		}

.. only:: windows or linux

	If you wish to run the application outside of you IDE, you will need to be aware of the working directory for the application to run correctly.	For example, To run the debug varinat of the Chapter2 application, use this:

.. only:: windows

	``[...]/<workspaceFolder>/build/Chapter2>"Debug/OpenXRTutorialChapter2"``

.. only:: linux

	``[...]/<workspaceFolder>/Chapter2 $ "../build/Chapter2/OpenXRTutorialChapter2"``

.. only:: android

	With all the source and build system files set up, we can now build our Android project. If while editing ``main.cpp`` or any other file you are seeing warnings like this: ``"This file does not belong to any project target..."``, right-click on the top-level folder of the project in the ``Project`` panel, select ``Mark Directory as >``, and click the option ``Sources Root``.

	To build your project go to the upper right of Android Studio, and there you should find the toolbar below. Click the green hammer icon to build the project, if all is successful you should see "BUILD SUCCESSFUL in [...]s" in the Build Output window. It is also recommended to sync the gradle files too.

	Next to the green hammer icon is the Run/Debug configuration dropdown menu. If that isn't populated, create a configuration called app.

	Turn on and connect your Android device. Set up any requirements for USB debugging and ``adb``. Your device should appear in the dropdown. Here, we are using a Meta Quest 2:

	.. figure:: images/android-studio-build-run-toolbar.png
		:alt: Build/Run Toolbar

	To debug/run the application click the green bug icon (the plain green bug, not the one with an arrow on it).


***********
1.5 Summary
